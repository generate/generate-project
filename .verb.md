### Running unit tests

It's never too early to begin running unit tests. When you're ready to get started, the following command will ensure the project's dependencies are installed then run all of the unit tests:

```sh
$ npm install && test
```

### Publishing your project

If you're tests are passing and you're ready to publish your project to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com), you can do that now with the following command:

**Are you sure you're ready?!**

```sh
$ npm publish
```
