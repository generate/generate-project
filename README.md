## Getting started

### Install

**Installing the CLI**

To run the `default` generator from the command line, you'll need to install [Generate](https://github.com/generate/generate) globally first. You can do that now with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate
```

This adds the `gen` command to your system path, allowing it to be run from any directory.

**Install generate-project**

Install this module with the following command:

```sh
$ npm install --global generate-project
```

### CLI

Run this generator's `default` [task](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/tasks.md#default) with the following command:

```sh
$ gen project
# or
$ gen project:default
```

**What will happen?**

Running `$ gen project` will run this generator's [default task](#default), which will:

1. prompt you for any information that's missing
2. render templates using your answers
3. generate [the resulting files](#generated-files) to the current working directory.

**Conflict detection**

In the case that a file already exists on the file system, you will be [prompted for feedback](https://github.com/node-base/base-fs-conflicts) _before overwrite any files_.

You can [set the destination](https://github.com/generate/generate/blob/master/docs/customization.md) to a new directory if you want to avoid the prompts, or avoid accidentally overwriting files with unintentional answers.

**What you should see in the terminal**

If completed successfully, you should see both `starting` and `finished` events in the terminal, like the following:

```sh
[00:44:21] starting ...
...
[00:44:22] finished ✔
```

If you do not see one or both of those events, please [let us know about it](../../issues).

### Help

To see a general help menu and available commands for Generate's CLI, run:

```sh
$ gen help
```
